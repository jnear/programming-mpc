PyChor adds *located values*---values known to a single party participating in the protocol---as special kinds of Python values. For example, the following choreography consists of a client and server, and the client knows that the value of the variable `x` is 5 (`x` is *located* at the client)."

For example, the following protocol constructs a value located at the client, then the client sends that value to the server."
