    "We saw a very simple application of MPC in Chapter 2 (counting the number of patients with heart disease, without sharing the underlying data), and we've now seen protocols for doing both addition and multiplication. What kinds of applications can we build with these tools, and how can we design APIs that make it easy to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this book, we'll use a style of encapsulating secret-shared data with *special objects* and defining operations on those objects using the fundamental MPC protocols we've learned about. For example, we'll start this chapter by defining a `SecInt` class for holding secret-shared integers, and we'll define addition and multiplication for these objects using the additive homomorphism and multiplication triples, respectively. This approach enables building applications that look very similar to traditional centralized Python programs, so that we don't need to worry about the details of the protocol when building applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative style, used commonly in the MPC literature, is to define MPC protocols that process *circuits*, and then to build applications by defining circuits. The circuits used in MPC are similar to hardware circuits, but have only addition and multiplication gates, and each wire in the circuit represents a secret-shared value. We'll cover circuits in detail in Chapter TODO."

    "\n",
    "What if we want to represent decimal numbers? Finite fields definitely can't do that! The most common approaches in MPC are inspired by techniques used in binary circuits used to build computers, such as [fixed-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) and [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic). However, the MPC versions of these techniques usually differ a bit from the hardware versions, because some things that are easy in a binary circuit are much more difficult using operations over finite fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind fixed- or floating-point numbers is that we can represent a decimal number like $0.3$ as an integer multiplied by some power of 10: $0.3 = 3 * 10^{-1}$. Computer hardware usually uses a base of 2 (instead of 2) because multiplying by a power of 2 can be accomplished via shifting. In the MPC world, we can use any base; we'll use 10 in this section for readability.\n",

    "## Application: Computing the Average Age of Heart Disease Patients\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have the tools needed to build a protocol that computes the average age of heart disease patients in the heart disease dataset, without revealing the sum of ages or the count of patients. We'll use the `SecDec` class to represent numbers, and the approach described above for computing the reciprocal. The guess for the reciprocal is important for ensuring we get the right answer, and this can be challenging in many applications. In this one, however, it's easy: each party's data has about half of the heart disease patients, so doubling the number of heart disease patients a single party has is a decent estimate of the total, and can be used to make a good guess at the reciprocal. Since the reciprocal is smaller in this example than the last one, we'll need to use an even larger finite field to avoid overflow. We include some debugging printouts to show the protocol working, but in a real deployment we'd keep the reciprocal secret."
