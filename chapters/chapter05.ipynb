    "We saw a very simple application of MPC in Chapter 2 (counting the number of patients with heart disease, without sharing the underlying data), and we've now seen protocols for doing both addition and multiplication. What kinds of applications can we build with these tools, and how can we design APIs that make it easy to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this book, we'll use a style of encapsulating secret-shared data with *special objects* and defining operations on those objects using the fundamental MPC protocols we've learned about. For example, we'll start this chapter by defining a `SecInt` class for holding secret-shared integers, and we'll define addition and multiplication for these objects using the additive homomorphism and multiplication triples, respectively. This approach enables building applications that look very similar to traditional centralized Python programs, so that we don't need to worry about the details of the protocol when building applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative style, used commonly in the MPC literature, is to define MPC protocols that process *circuits*, and then to build applications by defining circuits. The circuits used in MPC are similar to hardware circuits, but have only addition and multiplication gates, and each wire in the circuit represents a secret-shared value. We'll cover circuits in detail in Chapter TODO."
