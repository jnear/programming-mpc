    "## Building Additive Secret Shares\n",
    "\n",
    "An additive secret sharing scheme consists of at least 2 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `share(x,n)` generates `n` secret shares of the secret value `x`\n",
    "- `reconstruct(ss)` decrypts a secret value from a list `ss` of `n` secret shares\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key requirements for an additive secret sharing scheme are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `n` secret shares should add up to `x` (this is the \"additive\" part)\n",
    "2. *All* `n` secret shares are required to reconstruct `x` - it's impossible to learn anything about `x` from fewer than `n` shares (this is the \"secret\" part)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we meet both requirements at once? A simple way is to build the secret shares as *random numbers* (which clearly reveal nothing about the secret `x`), and then set the final share so that the shares add up to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we set $r_1, \\dots, r_{n-1}$ to random numbers, and then set $r_n$ to $x - \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r_i$. If we do this, it will definitely be true that $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last share is *not* random - doesn't that reveal something about $x$? Not if we do things carefully. The intuition is that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r_i$ is uniformly random since each of the $r_i$'s individually is uniformly random. This means that $x - \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r_i$ must also be uniformly random, since we're just adding a constant to a uniformly random value. This argument is basically correct, but it depends a lot on the definition of \"random number\" - which turns out to introduce some challenges, as discussed next."

    "One kind of modular arithmetic commonly used in cryptography is arithmetic over [finite fields](todo) (also called *Galois fields* after the French mathematician Galois, who invented them).

The Python objects that represent finite field elements implement the regular arithmetic operators (e.g. `+` and `*`), but perform modular arithmetic to produce field elements as output. For example, this program creates a finite field `gf` = $GF(p)$, then creates a field element object `x` for the number 8, and then adds `x` to itself.

Even larger primes are used when the protocol needs to represent even bigger numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a larger prime, the random shares are generated from a much larger set of numbers. This makes it more difficult to see that the shares add up to the right value, but running the protocol above with a larger field and the inputs 7 and 8 does result in the expected answer of 15. The following sequence diagram shows one execution of the protocol, using the prime $p= 2^{31} - 1$."

    "This graph has a similar shape, but the maximum and minimum are different - there are no results smaller than -5, and there are lots of results bigger than 10. Unfortunately, this is a sign that the second share - by itself - can sometimes reveal something about `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the second share's value is 15, then `x` *must have been* at least 5 - since the first share was between -10 and 10, any secret smaller than 5 would make it impossible for the second share to be 15.\n",

    "This is a major security flaw, since neither share by itself is supposed to reveal anything about `x`. To fix this problem, we could use larger bounds than -10 and 10, which might make it harder to observe one of the problematic cases - but no matter how large we make the bounds, the same kind of leeakage is possible at the extreme values."

    "# Application: Counting Heart Disease Patients\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two hospitals collect data about their patients, and they would like to collaborate to determine the prevalence of heart disease in the population. However, the hospitals are not willing to share their individual patient datasets with one another, since this could compromise the privacy of their patients. Instead, they would like to use a secure summation protocol to discover the total number of patients with heart disease between both hospitals, revealing *only* the total number of patients in the population with heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the famous [heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For our purposes, we've split the dataset into two parts: `heart1.csv` contains the first hospital's data, and `heart2.csv` contains the second hospital's data. The `target` column of the dataset contains a 1 if the patient has heart disease, and a 0 otherwise. To implement the desired protocol, we can use the following plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `count_heart_disease_patients` to count how many patients have heart disease\n",
    "2. Have each hospital load their data and run the function on it to count their patients with heart disease\n",
    "3. Run `secure_sum` between the hospitals to calculate the total number of patients with heart disease\n",
    "\n",
    "The program below implements this plan."

This reveals the total number of heart disease patients across both hospitals, which is strictly more information than the quotient by itself. However, our previous step already revealed this value, so we won't worry about it in this case. We'll need to implement more complicated protocols to avoid revealing this information."
