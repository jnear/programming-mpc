    "## Building Additive Secret Shares\n",
    "\n",
    "An additive secret sharing scheme consists of at least 2 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `share(x,n)` generates `n` secret shares of the secret value `x`\n",
    "- `reconstruct(ss)` decrypts a secret value from a list `ss` of `n` secret shares\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key requirements for an additive secret sharing scheme are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `n` secret shares should add up to `x` (this is the \"additive\" part)\n",
    "2. *All* `n` secret shares are required to reconstruct `x` - it's impossible to learn anything about `x` from fewer than `n` shares (this is the \"secret\" part)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we meet both requirements at once? A simple way is to build the secret shares as *random numbers* (which clearly reveal nothing about the secret `x`), and then set the final share so that the shares add up to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we set $r_1, \\dots, r_{n-1}$ to random numbers, and then set $r_n$ to $x - \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r_i$. If we do this, it will definitely be true that $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last share is *not* random - doesn't that reveal something about $x$? Not if we do things carefully. The intuition is that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r_i$ is uniformly random since each of the $r_i$'s individually is uniformly random. This means that $x - \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r_i$ must also be uniformly random, since we're just adding a constant to a uniformly random value. This argument is basically correct, but it depends a lot on the definition of \"random number\" - which turns out to introduce some challenges, as discussed next."

The Python objects that represent finite field elements implement the regular arithmetic operators (e.g. `+` and `*`), but perform modular arithmetic to produce field elements as output.

    "This graph has a similar shape, but the maximum and minimum are different - there are no results smaller than -5, and there are lots of results bigger than 10. Unfortunately, this is a sign that the second share - by itself - can sometimes reveal something about `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the second share's value is 15, then `x` *must have been* at least 5 - since the first share was between -10 and 10, any secret smaller than 5 would make it impossible for the second share to be 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a major security flaw, since neither share by itself is supposed to reveal anything about `x`. To fix this problem, we could use larger bounds than -10 and 10, which might make it harder to observe one of the problematic cases - but no matter how large we make the bounds, the same kind of leeakage is possible at the extreme values."
