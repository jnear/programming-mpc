    "Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a fundamental primitive used in many MPC protocols. As we'll see at the end of this chapter, it can be used to build a protocol for generating multiplication triples. It is also used as part of the online portion of other MPC protocols, as we'll see in later chapters.\n",

    "\n",
    "OT is a protocol between two parties: the *Sender* and the *Receiver*. The Sender provides two inputs, and the Receiver selects one of them. At the end of the protocol, the Receiver gets *only* one of the Sender's inputs (the selected one), and the Sender *does not know which input was selected* (this is the \"oblivious\" part - the Sender is oblivious to the selection decision). In fact, the Sender does not receive any output from OT. The ideal functionality for this version of OT, which is called 1-out-of-2 OT because the sender provides two inputs, is defined as follows:\n",

    "3. If $s = 0$, $\\mathcal{F}_\\text{OT}$ sends $x_0$ to the Receiver; if $s = 1$, $\\mathcal{F}_\\text{OT}$ sends $x_1$ to the Receiver\n",

    "In this section we'll define a simple protocol for OT that realizes the functionality in the semi-honest setting. Our approach follows Section 3.7 of [Pragmatic MPC](https://securecomputation.org/) and uses [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) as a fundamental building block. The asymmetry between Sender and Receiver in OT is very different from what we've seen in prior chapters, and it turns out that this asymmetry creates a deep link between OT and public-key cryptography (see Gertner et al. {cite}`gertner2000relationship`) for details).\n",

The [documentation for public-key cryptography in PyNaCl can be found here](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public/). Here's a simple example that generates a key pair, encrypts a value, and then decrypts the value. When using the PyNaCl library, everything is bytes (input values, keys, encrypted values, etc) - so we will often need to encode the values we want to encrypt into bytestrings before doing so."

    "In our OT protocol, the basic idea is for the Receiver to send two public keys to the Sender, and for the Sender to encrypt *both* secret inputs (one input per public key) and send the encrypted inputs back to the Receiver. However, the two public keys are special: one is generated as part of a key pair (so the Receiver knows the corresponding secret key), and the other is *totally random* (so no secret key exists, and *the Receiver cannot decrypt any message encrypted with it*). Which one is \"real\" and which one is random depends on the selection bit. This approach satisfies the requirements of the ideal functionality: the Receiver gets only the selected input (because they can't decrypt the other one), and the Sender gets nothing (because the two public keys both look random, without knowledge of how they were generated).\n",

    "## Generating Multiplication Triples using OT\n",
    "\n",
    "One important use of OT is to generate multiplication triples. We previously introduced the ideal functionality for generating multiplication triples, but we didn't implement a protocol realizing it because we didn't have the necessary tools. With OT, now we do!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the case of generating *binary* multiplication triples: the case where all secret values and secret shares are in $GF(2)$ (i.e. either 0 or 1). Since $GF(2)$ is a finite field, the protocols we built earlier that use multiplication triples will work just fine in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to generate secret-shared $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a*b = c$. Specifically, we want to end up in the following situation:\n",
    "- P1 knows $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$\n",
    "- P2 knows $a_2$, $b_2$, $c_2$\n",
    "- $(a_1+a_2)(b_1 + b_2) = c_1 + c_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get there, we'll use this basic idea:\n",
    "1. P1 picks $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$ randomly\n",
    "2. P2 picks $a_2$, $b_2$ randomly\n",
    "3. P1 and P2 run OT, with P1 as sender and P2 as receiver, so that P2 ends up with $c_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "What should the secret inputs and selection bit for OT be? We actually need *two* selection bits, and they'll be the values of P2's shares ($a_2$ and $b_2$). For the inputs, since we're working on $GF(2)$, P1 can build the a big truth table to list the possible values of $c_2$, and use the truth table to generate the set of secret inputs. An excerpt of the complete truth table for valid multiplication triples looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $a_1$ | $b_1$ | $c_1$ | $a_2$ | $b_2$ | $c_2$ |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     |\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     |\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete table is large, so we don't show it here. But to generate multiplication triples, we won't actually have to build the whole thing. When P1 builds the truth table to use in OT, P1 actually knows many of the values of the secret shares listed in it, and so most of the rows in the table can be eliminated. The only values P1 *doesn't* know are $a_2$ and $b_2$, and there are only four possible combinations of those values. So, we can write a function that builds the truth table for $a_2$ and $b_2$, given the values of the other shares:"
