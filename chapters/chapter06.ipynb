    "OT is a protocol between two parties: the *Sender* and the *Receiver*. The Sender provides two inputs, and the Receiver selects one of them. At the end of the protocol, the Receiver gets *only* one of the Sender's inputs (the selected one), and the Sender *does not know which input was selected* (this is the \"oblivious\" part - the Sender is oblivious to the selection decision). In fact, the Sender does not receive any output from OT. The ideal functionality for this version of OT, which is called 1-out-of-2 OT because the sender provides two inputs, is defined as follows:\n",

The asymmetry between Sender and Receiver in OT is very different from what we've seen in prior chapters, and it turns out that this asymmetry creates a deep link between OT and public-key cryptography (see Gertner et al. {cite}`gertner2000relationship`) for details).\n",

The [documentation for public-key cryptography in PyNaCl can be found here](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public/). Here's a simple example that generates a key pair, encrypts a value, and then decrypts the value. When using the PyNaCl library, everything is bytes (input values, keys, encrypted values, etc) - so we will often need to encode the values we want to encrypt into bytestrings before doing so."

    "In our OT protocol, the basic idea is for the Receiver to send two public keys to the Sender, and for the Sender to encrypt *both* secret inputs (one input per public key) and send the encrypted inputs back to the Receiver. However, the two public keys are special: one is generated as part of a key pair (so the Receiver knows the corresponding secret key), and the other is *totally random* (so no secret key exists, and *the Receiver cannot decrypt any message encrypted with it*). Which one is \"real\" and which one is random depends on the selection bit. This approach satisfies the requirements of the ideal functionality: the Receiver gets only the selected input (because they can't decrypt the other one), and the Sender gets nothing (because the two public keys both look random, without knowledge of how they were generated).\n",

    "- Sender has secret inputs $x_0$ and $x_1$\n",
    "- Receiver has selection bit $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parties Sender and Receiver follow the following steps:\n",
    "1. The Receiver generates a key pair $sk$, $pk$, and samples a random public key, $pk'$, from the public key space. If $s = 0$, the Receiver sends the pair $(pk, pk')$ to the Sender; if $s = 1$, the receiver sends the pair $(pk', pk)$ to the Sender.\n",
    "2. The Sender receives $(pk_0, pk_1)$ and sends back to the Receiver two encryptions $e_0 = \\text{Enc}_{pk_0}(x_0), e_1 = \\text{Enc}_{pk_1}(x_1)$.\n",
    "3. The Receiver receives $e_0, e_1$ and decrypts the ciphertext $e_s$ using $sk$. The Receiver is unable to decrypt the second ciphertext as it does not have the corresponding secret key.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation follows the same steps, but uses the PyNaCl API to perform the key generation, encryption, and decryption operations. Since PyNaCl only supports encrypting bytes, the protocol converts the secret inputs to bytestrings (the protocol expects the inputs to be integers, and returns an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation also generalizes the idea to 1-out-of-$n$ OT, where $n$ is any positive integer. To do this, the Receiver provides a selection index as an integer between 0 and $n-1$ (rather than just a bit), the Receiver generates $n-1$ fake public keys (rather than 1), the Sender sends $n$ encrypted values to the Receiver, and the Receiver is able to decrypt only one of them. Common variants of OT are 1-out-of-2 (as described above) and 1-out-of-4 (as we'll use in the next section)."

    "## Application: Generating Binary Multiplication Triples using OT\n",
    "\n",
    "One important use of OT is to generate multiplication triples. We previously introduced the ideal functionality for generating multiplication triples, but we didn't implement a protocol realizing it because we didn't have the necessary tools. With OT, now we do!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the case of generating *binary* multiplication triples: the case where all secret values and secret shares are in $GF(2)$ (i.e. either 0 or 1). Since $GF(2)$ is a finite field, the protocols we built earlier that use multiplication triples will work just fine in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to generate secret-shared $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a*b = c$. Specifically, we want to end up in the following situation:\n",
    "- P1 knows $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$\n",
    "- P2 knows $a_2$, $b_2$, $c_2$\n",
    "- $(a_1+a_2)(b_1 + b_2) = c_1 + c_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get there, we'll use this basic idea:\n",
    "1. P1 picks $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$ randomly\n",
    "2. P2 picks $a_2$, $b_2$ randomly\n",
    "3. P1 and P2 run OT, with P1 as sender and P2 as receiver, so that P2 ends up with $c_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "What should the secret inputs and selection bit for OT be? We actually need to use *two* selection bits: the values of P2's shares ($a_2$ and $b_2$). For the inputs, since we're working in $GF(2)$, P1 can build the a big truth table to list the possible values of $c_2$, and use the truth table to generate the set of secret inputs. An excerpt of the complete truth table for valid multiplication triples looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $a_1$ | $b_1$ | $c_1$ | $a_2$ | $b_2$ | $c_2$ |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     |\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n",
    "| 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     |\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete table is large, so we don't show it here. But to generate multiplication triples, we won't actually have to build the whole thing. When P1 builds the truth table to use in OT, P1 actually knows many of the values of the secret shares listed in it, and so most of the rows in the table can be eliminated. The only values P1 *doesn't* know are $a_2$ and $b_2$, and there are only four possible combinations of those values. So, we can write a function that builds the truth table for $a_2$ and $b_2$, given the values of the other shares:"

    "## Application: Generating Arithmetic Multiplication Triples using OT\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to generate multiplication triples in $GF(2)$, but all of the example applications in prior chapters were in $GF(p)$ rather than $GF(2)$, so this doesn't seem very useful. We'll see additional applications in later chapters where they are useful, but for now it would be great to be able to generate triples in $GF(p)$ instead. This is a more difficult problem that requires a slightly more complex protocol to solve. We'll start by assuming that the parties will generate shares of $a$ and $b$ randomly, then compute $c$ by multiplying. Recall that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "c &= (a_1 + a_2)(b_1 + b_2)\\\\\n",
    "&= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term involves shares known by P1, and the second one involes shares known by P2. We'll (tentatively) set the shares of $c$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "c_1' &= a_1 b_1\\\\\n",
    "c_2' &= a_2 b_2\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parties can compute these shares locally, without communication. However, these are not quite the shares we want: $c_1' + c_2'$ is missing the cross-terms $a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1$ from the earlier equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use OT to build secret shares of $t = a_1 b_2$ and $u = a_2 b_1$. Specifically, we'll generate the shares:\n",
    "- $t_1 = - r$ where P1 knows $r$ but doesn't know $a_1 b_2$\n",
    "- $t_2 = r + a_1 b_2$ where P2 *doesn't* know $r$\n",
    "- $u_1 = - s$ where P1 knows $s$ but doesn't know $a_2 b_1$\n",
    "- $u_2 = s + a_2 b_1$ where P2 *doesn't* know $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the values $r$ and $s$ act as *masks* to allow sharing the cross-term's value without revealing it. Once we've accomplished this, we can set the two shares of $c$:\n",
    "- $c_1 = c_1' + t_1 + u_1 = a_1 b_1 - r - s$\n",
    "- $c_2 = c_2' + t_2 + u_2 = a_2 b_2 + r + a_1 b_2 + s + a_2 b_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, we get that $c_1 + c_2 = a b$, as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the secret shares of $t$ and $u$, we'll use a process called *bit decomposition* to convert arithmetic shares into binary digits, and then use 1-out-of-2 OT to deliver a bitwise masked version of the correct share to P2. P2 will be able to sum the bits to obtain their shares of $t$ and $u$. Here's a function `bit_decompose` to turn a field element into an equivalent list of bits. For a field with characteristic $p$, we'll need $\\lceil \\log_2(p) \\rceil$ bits to represent the number."
