    "The Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson protocol {cite}`ben1988completeness` is another classic MPC protocol, this time employing Shamir secret sharing and arithmetic circuits. The BGW protocol performs multiplication using the limited multiplicative homomorphism of Shamir shares. The BGW protocol naturally supports more than 2 parties, and actually *requires* at least 3 parties for the standard variant.\n",

    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic ideas behind the BGW protocol are:\n",
    "- All values are field elements in $GF(p)$ for some (usually large) prime $p$\n",
    "- Parties hold Shamir secret shares of values, and shares are built as described in Chapter 9\n",
    "- Parties perform addition locally, via the additive homomorphism of the shares\n",
    "- Parties perform multiplication using the limited multiplicative homomorphism of the shares, with a *degree reduction* step to avoid the threshold $t$ growing too large\n",
    "- We start with the threshold $t = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ where $n$ is the number of parties, so that we can use the limited multiplicative homomorphism of the shares\n",
    "- This means the protocol requires an *honest majority*: if more than half of the parties are corrupted, they can decrypt any value they like with the shares they hold\n",
    "\n",
    "We first present the protocols for input, reveal, and multiplication, then build a BGW-based `SecInt` class that implements the BGW protocol. As a building block, we'll use the `ShamirShare` class that we defined in Chapter 9. We'll also use functions from Chapter 9 for secret sharing and reconstruction with Shamir shares."

    "## BGW: Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To multiply two secret-shared values $x$ and $y$ where $t \\leq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $n$ is the number of parties, each party can multiply their shares locally to get one share of the product. Unfortunately, the degree of the resulting polynomial could be as high as $n$, so we won't be able to do more than one multiplication this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use a simplified version of BGW multiplication called GRR multiplication. This approach was proposed by Gennaro, Rabin, and Rabin {cite}`gennaro1998simplified` and is commonly implemented instead of the original. GRR multiplication works by having each party multiply shares locally to obtain one share with a high threshold, then performing a *degree reduction* step to bring the threshold back down to $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we assume that each party holds one share of $x$ and one share of $y$ with degree $t \\leq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$, and each party multiplies shares locally (as in Chapter 9) to obtain on share of $z = xy$ with degree $n \\leq n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the degree reduction, we use the [Vandermonde matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix#Applications), a special matrix that enables *polynomial interpolcation via matrix multiplication*. In particular, for a polynomial $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + ... a_n x^n$, there is a Vandermonde matrix $V$ such that the following holds:\n",

    "Notice that in our setting, the first coefficient $a_0$ *is the secret* $z$, and the right-hand side of the equation is exactly equal to the secret shares held by the parties after multipling their shares locally. To recover the secret $a_0$, if we had all of the shares $f(1) ... f(n)$, we could invert $V$ and do some algebra:\n",

    "The central trick of GRR multiplication solves this problem: each party *secret-shares their share*, then computes *one share of the interpolation result* using their shares of $f(1) \\dots f(n)$.
