    "The Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol {cite}`goldreich1987play` is a classic MPC protocol typically described in terms of evaluating binary circuits. The GMW protocol performs multiplication using Oblivious Transfer (OT), in a similar way to the protocol for generating binary multiplication triples in Chapter 6 (if you squint, they're almost identical, except that GMW performs the OT during the  online phase of the protocol). The GMW protocol can be extended to support arithmetic circuits and more than 2 parties.\n",

Since the values are all binary, we can take exactly the same approach as the multiplication triple generation protocol in Chapter 6: P1 will generate their share of the result $z_1$ randomly, then generate a truth table for the value of $z_2$ in terms of P2's shares of $x$ and $y$ and use OT to deliver $z_2$ to P2.\n",
