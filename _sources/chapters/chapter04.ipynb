    "## Why use Multiplication Triples?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiplication triples to do multiplication of additive secret shares has a major issue: it requires the presence of a trusted dealer, or the use of a more complicated (and expensive) protocol to generate the triples. A trusted dealer generally obviates the need for a secure protocol in the first place, since the dealer could simply perform the multiplication themselves! So, what's the point of using multiplication triples?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll continue to see throughout this book: *secure multiplication is hard*. There is no magical solution that provides a simple, convenient, efficient approach for multiplication (as we have for addition, via the additive homomorphism of secret shares). Alternatives to multiplication triples make different tradeoffs, but none of them provides a solution that is better in every way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication triple approach differs from many of the alternatives by separating the triple generation step from the multiplication itself. This has several advantages:\n",
    "- It makes protocols modular: a protocol that uses multiplication triples to perform multiplication can choose from many different approaches for *generating* the triples, and any of them will work. We'll see examples of these later in the book.\n",
    "- It allows generating triples in parallel, since triples are independent from each other.\n",
    "- It enables performing the expensive triple generation portion as a pre-processing step, since the triples don't depend on the actual input to the protocol. This is often referred to as an \"offline\" step that the parties can perform ahead of time. In settings where reacting quickly to new inputs is important, this can be a huge benefit.\n",
    "- It makes the multiplication step simple: the approach presented in this chapter is perhaps the simplest protocol for multiplying secret shares.\n"
